    <p>  Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Bender, quit destroying the universe!</p>

<p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Do a flip!</p>

<p>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? When will that be? Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</p>

<p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You wouldn't. Ask anyway!</p>
